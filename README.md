# Delivery-Shop-Simulation
Simulation model to research the manufacturing of toys involving two contractors (A and B). The simulation estimates the number of days needed to produce 100 batches before a Christmas market deadline, considering different service times and a confidence level of 95%. The report is keen on figuring out highest quality time for the store to area the order for the toys, as well as the gold standard distribution of the order among the two contractors a good way to minimize ready waiting time.
